# Data-Driven-Banking-Loan-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
This project is to analyze banking client and loan data using Power BI, by creating an  interactive dashboard that uncovers key insights into client demographics, loan patterns, and  growth trends, enabling data-driven decision-making in the banking sector

# ðŸš€ Project Process
## 1. Problem Statement

Analyze the banking dataset to uncover customer behavior, financial patterns, and business insights.

Build interactive dashboards in Power BI for visualization
## 2. Data Collection

Input file: Banking.csv (raw dataset).

Stored inside the data/ folder.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) or in a Jupyter Notebook (EDA.ipynb).

### Key steps:

### Data Understanding

Load dataset and check first few rows.

Shape of dataset (rows, columns).

Column descriptions and data types.

### Data Cleaning

Handle missing values (NaN).

Remove duplicates.

Convert categorical columns to correct data types.

### Univariate Analysis

Distribution of age, balance, loan status, etc.

Count plots for categorical variables (e.g., job, marital status, education).

### Bivariate Analysis

Relationship between balance and job.

Loan approval vs income/education.

Age vs subscription to term deposit.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation heatmap for numerical variables.

### Outlier Detection

Boxplots for balance, age, and loan amounts.

#### Deliverables:

Visualizations (histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots).

Summary of key findings.

## 4. Data Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)

Use the cleaned dataset in Power BI (Banking_domain.pbix).

Build dashboards showing:

Customer demographics

Loan approvals and defaults

Deposits and balances

Risk & segmentation
